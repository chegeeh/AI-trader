The code aims to analyze historical Bitcoin prices using various machine learning algorithms to try and predict whether prices will go up or down in the future. The data is sourced from a cryptocurrency API and pre-processed for use in different algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and deep neural networks. The accuracy of each algorithm is measured and compared to see which one performs best in making predictions. In addition, there is an implementation of a technical analysis algorithm that uses a library called "ta" to calculate harmonic patterns based on historical Bitcoin prices. Overall, the goal of this code is to explore different machine learning techniques for predicting future Bitcoin prices based on past data.
